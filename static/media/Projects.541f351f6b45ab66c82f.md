# Personal projects
Some of my best personal projects.

## DevOps / Docker
Docker is an applications standartization tool. It allows developers
to package and run applications from inside containers, always starting
the same environment and escaping the dependency hell.

This is a repository that contains example projects with docker
and other technologies like nodejs to show that I'm capable of 
developing and running containerized applications.

## DevOps / Terraform
Terraform is a great tool for provisioning and deploying infrastructure
on small and large scale. It allows for automation and optimization of
resources and saves a lot of time.

My terraform repository contains a bunch of example projects that I
made and documented to show my skills and abilities to handle real-life cases for development and production of applications.

## 2D Web Fabric Simulator
This simulator is a little fun toy I created a while ago. It's really fun to play around with. I made it to deepen my understanding of physics and computing.

I implemented different ways of interacting with the physical material of the fabric. Including creation and connection of vericies, and moving and destroying the fabric itself.

I've also implemented a few nodges for physicla variables, including changing gravity, friction, and bounce level.

## Python Sockets Library
I created a python-based sockets library that allows for easy communication between two or more nodes, just like a server-client system.

I made this project to deepen my knowledge of computer networking that started my passion for DevOps in the first place. It uses tcp/ip protocol
for internet communication and has a feature for traffic encryption, as vell as a verbosity switch.
