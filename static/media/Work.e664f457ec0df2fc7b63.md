# Work experience

A little about my work experience with the IT industry. 

## Junior DevOps Engineer at Logivations
Logivations, a software company based in Germany, Munich. I worked there from ***2022-02*** to ***2022-07***.
After a quick onboarding and acquaintance with the Operations / DevOps team that consisted of me and 3 other people, I quickly got down to work.

My main responsibilities were:
1. Optimization and maintenance of the pipelines & docker image build configuration.
2. Work with linux and networking, setting up, configuring and maintaining company servers and software running on those servers. 

I worked a lot with Bash and Linux in those months, carrying around a laptop with Ubuntu on board as my daily driver.
