# Work experience

A little about my work experience with the IT industry. Going from the latest to the earliest, LIFO, as they say.

## Junior DevOps Engineer at Logivations
Logivations, a software company based in Germany, Munich. I worked there from ***2022-02*** to ***2022-07***.
After a quick onboarding and acquaintance with the Operations / DevOps team that consisted of me and 3 other people, I quickly got down to work.

My main responsibilities were:
1. Optimization and maintenance of the pipelines & docker image build configuration.
2. Work with Linux and networking, setting up, configuring, and maintaining company servers and software running on those servers. 

I worked a lot with Bash and Linux in those months, carrying around a laptop with Ubuntu on board as my daily driver. 

## Junior DevOps Engineer at Idealogic
Idealogic, is a software development company based in Ukraine, where I lived prior to the war. I worked there from ***2021-07*** to ***2022-02***.
It was a much harder experience. Most of the time I was working as a solo DevOps combined with the development team on every
project I was assigned to. I gained a lot of production experience with cloud providers such as GCP and AWS while working
on different projects simultaneously.

Here are some of my responsibilities:
1. Creating and maintaining pipelines for the development team and production environments.
2. Optimizing the cost and effectiveness of the current infrastructure on the cloud.
3. Write configuration files for docker container clusters on AWS.
4. Manage running docker containers on development and production environments.
5. Working with different teams and project managers simultaneously, maximizing effectiveness.

While working there, I successfully used such DevOps technologies as:
1. Jenkins for CI/CD pipelines & GitLab-CI for dev code deployments.
2. Docker for containerizing applications for scalable deployments.
3. AWS serverless clustering service: ECS.
4. GCP monitoring and alert services.
5. Jira issue tracking & team collaboration.
6. A lot more.

## Personal Assistant to a Senior DevOps
I worked for Mykola Bodnar from ***2021-03*** to ***2021-06***, back in Ukraine. At the time, he was 
working as a Senior DevOps for Lohika Systems, one of the most known IT companies in Ukraine. 
I worked on a lot of projects for Mykola, touching every aspect of DevOps engineering. 
I created Docker templates, and infrastructure with terraform combined with Terragrunt. I wrote a lot of
ansible scripts for the development configuration, and a lot more.

Here's a list of technologies I worked with to be exact:
1. Terraform & Terragrunt templates.
2. Jenkins pipelines for different staging environments.
3. Kubernetes deployments, stateless web applications with microservice architecture.
4. Ansible playbooks and configuration scripts.
5. Linux and Bash scripting.
6. ASP.net and windows docker containers.

I completed a list of projects for Mykola, expanding and extending my knowledge into the DevOps sphere.

## Intern Software Developer at Driveroo
My first real work experience came from Burlingame, California. Driveroo Inc is a software development company. I worked as an intern for a more senior software developer working remotely, in Ukraine. I mostly used python to create automation scripts and other tools to increase team productivity and effectiveness. This was the company where I learned my first technologies and got a chance to shine with my soft skills.

I used the following technologies to achieve target goals:

* Python, a lot of pythons.
* Scraping and reorganizing data with Python and JSON formatting.
* JavaScript & Jquery to build web interfaces.
* Computer Vision technologies for labeling automation.
* Jenkins Pipelines to combine all of this.

I created a few projects during the Spain of my internship, and I gained a lot of experience in proper documentation and teamwork.
